# Tetra
--
Command Tetra is an extended services package for TS6 IRC daemons with Lua and
Moonscript support.

Tetra is more of a functional experiment than a services package right now. It
still needs many things to be production ready, but here is what it has so far:

- Yaml API
- Lua / Moonscript script loading
- Hooking on protocol events
- Hooking on arbitrary events
- Client/Channel/Server link tracking
- Statistics via influxdb

Things still in progress:

- Feature parity with Cod
- Documentation on migration from Cod to Tetra
- Atheme integration
- Scripts being able to define webpages

## Installation

- `lua5.1`
