Usage: JOIN <[service]|channel> [channel]

Joins a service to a channel (by default the main service). This can be invoked
in one of two ways. The first allows you to join the core service to a channel
and the second allows you to join any arbitrary service to a channel. The service
name is the short name ("tetra" instead of "{{$client := index .Tetra.Services "tetra"}}{{$client.Nick}}".)

This command will fail if the channel does not exist on the network.

Examples:
    JOIN #opers
    JOIN chatbot #opers
