Usage: VHOSTPOLICY <subcommand> [args]

VHOSTPOLICY is a way for administrators to automatically set a list of policies
for vhosts to be rejected and activated without operator intervention. It can be
used for quick turnarounds in HostServ requests or to maintain a list of "bad
words" administrators want to forbid from being inside a vhost.

Subcommands:
    ADD <lua pattern> <REJECT|ACTIVATE>
    DELETE <id>
    INFO <id>
    LIST

ADD:
    ADD adds a vhost policy to the list and immediately makes it effective. The
    policy may be any valid lua pattern. http://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html

    Usage:
        VHOSTPOLICY ADD <lua pattern> <REJECT|ACTIVATE>

    Examples:
        VHOSTPOLICY ADD foo REJECT
        VHOSTPOLICY ADD bar ACTIVATE

DELETE:
    DELETE deletes a vhost policy from the list by id.

    Usage:
        VHOSTPOLICY DELETE <id>

    Example:
        VHOSTPOLICY DELETE 1

INFO:
    INFO displays information on a vhost policy by id.

    Usage:
        VHOSTPOLICY INFO <id>

    Example:
        VHOSTPOLICY INFO 1

LIST:
    LIST displays all vhost policies.

    Example:
        VHOSTPOLICY LIST
